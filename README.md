library
=======

A Public library for KiCad parts. Please contribute! 

Each addition, whether to an existing library, or otherwise, must include a part + footprint.  Please try to create schematic parts for IC's by grouping functional buses together.

Be wary of quality enforcement, (no shitty parts please), it will take something damn special to allow you to contribute again if one of your additions is found to be lacking in quality. If you aren't sure: ask.
